<!--
     Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
     It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.
     Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
     https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project
     In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
     https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
     You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
     https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
